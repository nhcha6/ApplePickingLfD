# ApplePickingLfD
Project for learning obstacle avoidance and path planning policies for robotic apple harvesting from demonstrations delivered in simulation. The project aims to combine a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with a Mixed Density Network (MDN) to model users control strategy while manipulating in clutter.
